				>Mi Casa Cake Shop is a storefront bakery owned by an entrepreneurial

				and sees no plan in stopping</p
			>

			<span class="h6">About the Project</span>
			<p
				>Mi Casa Cake Shop recently opened its first storefront. More phone
				calls, messages, and walk-ins rolled in than ever before. They quickly
				saw the need to consolidate and systematize her order-taking
				procedure.</p
			>

			<p
				>Mi Casa came to me with their problem. I understood her issue when it
				came to workflow and technical limitations so it seemed I would be a
				great fit. We collaborate and found out we needed to centralize her
				conversations to one device and one application, simplify her cake
				orders, and track and visualize her progress.</p
			>

			<span class="h6">How I Made It</span>
			<p
				>The project's north star was categorizing all of the incoming requests
				and integrating them into the workflow.</p
			>

			<p
				>I first created a paper order form for all the details they needed for
				the cake order. Then I created two online versions: One we use to create
				orders internally and a second one on our website where the public can
				place an order online. Mi Casa can print online orders onto the exact
				order form as the paper version. They use the printed order forms on a
				large Kanban wall where the progress is monitored and visualized.</p
			>

			<p
				>Lastly, I consolidated text messages, Facebook's Messenger, and
				Instagram's Direct Messages into one location.</p
			>

			<p
				>As a result of working with Mi Casa, they've seen and felt the ease of
				taking orders. Seamless workflow integration was the driving force in
				creating the web app.</p

			<span class="h6">About the Project</span>
			<p
				>Mi Casa Cake Shop didn't have a Business ID but heard how powerful it
				can be. She knew having a consistent design throughout her business
				gains customer trust and recognition. But what she didn't know was what
				message she wanted to send and how.</p
			>

			<p
				>Mi Casa came to me with her problem and I understood her issue when it
				came to design and language barrier so it seemed I would be a great fit.
				We collaborate and found out that a logo, business cards, building sign,
				and a website would solve her issues of not being identified,
				introducing herself, having her storefront found, and having an online
				presence.</p
			>

			<span class="h6">How I Made It</span>
			<p
				>The project's north star was the warmth and hospitality of the Hispanic
				culture. The logo's colors reflect the bright and vibrant Latin tile
				used in home decoration. This carries to her business cards which make a
				great first impression.</p
			>

			<p
				>As a result of working with Mi Casa's they've seen the true spirit of
				bringing every business to the market. Proper translation was a driving
				force in creating her website. Every page is available to her customer's
				native language—English and Spanish. With love and attention, you'll
				feel at home at Mi Casa.</p

			>

			<span class="h6">How I Made It</span>
			<p
				>The project's north star was the supportive energy of WSC's Fit Family

			<p
				>As a result of working with WSC's they've seen the true spirit of

				emails, members get the same instruction on how to better themselves
